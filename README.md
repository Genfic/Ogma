# Ogma

Readme (and the software itself) under construction. Expect it to
contain something when the code itself is ready for prime time.

## Requirements

.NET 6, PostgreSQL

To run some helper scripts contained in the [taskfile](./taskfile.yml), the companion tool,
[Genfic/Tool](https://github.com/Genfic/Tool) needs to be installed.

## License

[GPL-3](LICENSE.md) until release. Then, most probably, MIT.

## Acknowledgements
